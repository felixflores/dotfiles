# My Dotfiles

Run `script/setup` to make the magic happen.

## Adding New Dotfiles

Simply add a file or directory to the `files/` path, and then add it to the
`config.yml` file to setup the assignment map. For optional links, make sure
to set the `optional` flag to `true` for the link in question.

## Vim Configuration

Please see the [Vim Customization](vim.md) file for details on the customization.
